over these states. to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world. \\nhe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. \\nhe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them. \\nhe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. \\nhe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. \\nhe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. \\nhe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasions from without and convulsions within. \\nhe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands. \\nhe has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers. \\nhe has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries. \\nhe has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. \\nhe has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures. \\nhe has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power. \\nhe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign toour constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation \\nfor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us \\nfor protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states \\nfor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world \\nfor imposing taxes on us without our consent \\nfor depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury \\nfor transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses \\nfor abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies \\nfor taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments \\nfor suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. \\nhe has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us. \\nhe has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burned our towns and destroyed the lives of our people. \\nhe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation. \\nhe has constrained our fellowcitizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands. \\nhe has excited domestic insurrection among us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions. \\nin every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. \\nnor have we been wanting in our attentions to our british brethren. we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. \\nthey too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. \\nwe must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends. \\nwe therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare. \\nthat these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. \\nand for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor. \\n'"
